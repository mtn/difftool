# difftool

This is a chrome devtool extension for easily viewing the style difference between two elements in the `DOM`.

When I have to work on the front-end for something I often find myself manually scrolling through the styles being applied to two elements, trying to find what different styles are being applied. This tool does this automatically.

Disclaimers: 

- There might be a better way to do things that I'm just missing, not being much of a webdev. I'd love to hear about any better methods :-)
- This does not work as intended yet -- just styles defined directly on the objects show up in diffs.
